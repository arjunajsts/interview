What is JavaScript.?
JavaScript is a high-level programming language 
it uses a objects and prototype for building structure
   -- objects is a collection of related data and functionality it is key value pair structure
      where the keys are called properties and values can be data types , including other object
   -- prototype is an object that other object can inherit properties 

it supports multiple programming styles (functional and object-oriented)
and runs code either by interpreting it or compiling in just in time it dynamically adjust type 
snd support functions as first class entities

Functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
