Introduction
Good Morning / Good Afternoon!
My name is Mallik, and I am a React-focused software developer with 3 years of experience building scalable and efficient web applications.

I specialize in frontend development, particularly using React, where I have created reusable components, optimized performance, and integrated APIs to deliver seamless user experiences.

I hold an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), graduating in 2021.

Recently, I started expanding my skill set to the backend by learning Node.js and MongoDB, aiming to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.

What is JavaScript.?
JavaScript is a high-level programming language 
it uses a objects and prototype for building structure
   -- objects is a collection of related data and functionality it is key value pair structure
      where the keys are called properties and values can be data types , including other object
   -- prototype is an object that other object can inherit properties 

it supports multiple programming styles (functional and object-oriented)
and runs code either by interpreting it or compiling in just in time it dynamically adjust type 
snd support functions as first class entities

Functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
